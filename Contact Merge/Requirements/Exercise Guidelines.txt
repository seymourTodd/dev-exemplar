Write a program that will merge two lists of contacts together and output the merged result.

For one contact list, please read a file that contains contacts that are formatted in Json, 
following the class definition below. Example Json is also included below.

For the second contact list, please create a list of contacts following the same format, 
simulating a list of contacts that could have been read from somewhere else (ex. a database).
No need to do anything with a database -- a hardcoded list in memory simulating something 
read from a database is all that is needed.

Write an algorithm that will merge the contacts that are read from the file with the list of contacts
 you have hardcoded in your program.   You should merge contacts that appear to be same person -- 
 and output the merged combined contacts.   The algorithm should be able to work efficiently, being 
 able to merge a large number of contacts quickly.

Write the results of the merge operation to another file.

This should be a console type application where the contact reading / merging / writing code runs in a 
separate thread and doesn’t exit until the output file is written.

Please make sure the code is easy to follow and understand following standard coding conventions.

Class definition:

public class Contact
{
    public string FirstName { get; set;}
    public string  LastName { get; set; }
    public string EmailAddress { get; set; }
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set;}
    public string JobTitle { get; set; }
    public string JobCompany { get; set; }
}

Example Json that can be copied to the file to read:

[
       {"FirstName":"Guy","LastName":"Tester","EmailAddress":"guy@tester.org","PhoneNumber":"703-555-1212","JobTitle":"Dude","JobCompany":"CircleBack"},          {"FirstName":"John","LastName":"Tester","EmailAddress":"john@tester.org","PhoneNumber":"703-555-1212","JobTitle":"Dude","JobCompany":"CircleBack"},    	    
        {"FirstName":"Jane","LastName":"Tester","EmailAddress":"jane@tester.org","PhoneNumber":"703-555-9876","JobTitle":"Dudette","JobCompany":"Dub Labs"},    
        {"FirstName":"Betty","LastName":"Tester","EmailAddress":"betty@tester.org","PhoneNumber":"703-555-2343","JobTitle":"Dudette","JobCompany":"IBM"},       
        {"FirstName":"Ted","LastName":"Nolan","EmailAddress":"ted@tester.org","PhoneNumber":"301-555-2343","JobTitle":"Coach","JobCompany":"Sabres"},   
        {"FirstName":"Dianna","LastName":"Russini","EmailAddress":"diana@tester.org","PhoneNumber":"212-555-2343","JobTitle":"Repoter","JobCompany":"NBC"},
        {"FirstName":"Jim","LastName":"Kelly","EmailAddress":"jim@tester.org","PhoneNumber":"716-555-2343","JobTitle":"QA","JobCompany":"Bills"},
        {"FirstName":"Tim","LastName":"Murray","EmailAddress":"tim@tester.org","PhoneNumber":"716-545-2343","JobTitle":"GM","JobCompany":"Sabres"}
